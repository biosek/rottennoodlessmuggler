ROTTEN NOODLES SMUGGLER
=======================

*Survival game for [GBJAM 2](http://gbjam.net).*

Nothing to see here yet, BUT! You actually _can_ see the nothing through your
browser. Just navigate it to http://nuclearwhales.github.io/rottennoodlessmuggler
and behold the empty grey rectangle. Should work with WebGL-enabled Firefox or
Chrome.

Technical details
-----------------

*If you are into this sort of things.*

This game is made with [Magnum](https://github.com/mosra/magnum), coded in
C++11 and compiled using [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten)
into JavaScript and WebGL.
